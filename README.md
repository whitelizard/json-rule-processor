# json-rule-processor

Load and run async JSON-Lisp configurations - with triggers, conditions, actions & more.

This package is meant to give a ton of possibilities to what a JSON configuration can do. It will turn JSON into a functional asyncronous programming language, but packaged as "rule configurations".

## By example

```js
const conf = {};
```
